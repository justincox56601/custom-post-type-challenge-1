This is the TwentyNineteen theme from Wordpress with the 'resources' custom post type already integrated.

Functions.php
The whole project is integrated in the functions.php file at the bottom with:
    include get_template_directory() . '/resources/resources-cpt.php';
    $ResourcesCPT = new ResourcesCPT();

The rest of the code is found in the resources folder.
